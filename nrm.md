# New Rousseau Machine

Rather than starting with improvements to an existing city, Makuhari City began
to develop governance mechanisms first (the operating system) to ponder an
alternative to the city&rsquo;s shape that we now live.

As a pilot project, we developed a multi-rule voting system, The &ldquo;New Roussau
Machine,&rdquo; that outputs different voting results using four separate aggregation
rules. We have shown that the four rules would not always converge into the same
outcome, thus presenting a parallel world. Visitors will imagine the future
using different democratic methods while observing the rules themselves present
other collective wills calling for more deliberation.

The votes collected by the people participating in this project (i.e., the
citizens) will define the direction of the Multi-Layered City &ldquo;Makuhari City&rdquo;
project with the entire budget raised through taxes, crowdfunding, and donations
to verify decentralized governance. This poll will influence the policy of the
multi-layered city of Makuhari (and may be adopted as is).

The system utilizes decentralized storage in transparency, and the results
making it tamper-proof. The results of this vote will guide further development
of this project to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that advocates
the cultivation of art and culture.

# Aggregation Rules

For a single act of voting, we obtained voting results according to the
following four aggregation rules.

-   Direct democracy
    
    The aggregation of the votes for the single most supportive item in each
    category, not counting proxy votes.

-   Indirect democracy
    
    Excluding direct votes, a popular vote was taken among the delegates. The
    final result will come from the winning delegate&rsquo;s direct ballot.

-   Borda count
    
    A system in which proxy votes are excluded, but the rankings of
    each direct vote item are determined. The lowest-ranked option gets 0 points,
    the next-lowest receives 1 point, etc., and the highest-ranked candidate gets
    n − 1 points, where n is the number of candidates.

-   Liquid Democracy
    
    A method of voting that combines direct and indirect democracy.

# Topics

We asked the participants to vote on following three questions that would help
us decide the future direction of Makuhari City. In addition to the direct vote
on each topic, we also asked the participants how much they would trust within
five delegates to handle this topic and asked for indirect proxy votes for the
delegates at the same time.


## Q1: Overall Policy


### Option 1: A city with an eye toward future generations

The project will explore different methods of urban management, including the
essential functions of a city, such as collective consensus building and
festivity. In collaboration with urban researchers and engineers worldwide, we
will develop new systems and conduct demonstrations of globally acclaimed
institutions in the physical Makuhari (幕張) area (Hanamigawa(花見川区) and
Mihama(美浜区) wards of Chiba City). We will hold international conferences and
support the production of demonstration experiments and research projects and
position the city itself to become a world-class urban research institution. We
will also actively support the update of Chiba City&rsquo;s administrative services,
transforming it into a city that reflects the will of its citizens the most.


### Option 2: A city with artists, by artists, for artists

In Japan, where the promotion of culture is still in its infancy, we will create
a new mutually supportive system for artists scattered throughout Japan as
citizens, including financial support without depending on governmental
subsidies and function as a platform for sharing ideas and networks. We will
also approach the budget of Chiba City, which is an actual administrative
district. Basing this physical area will establish itself as a sacred place for
artists in Japan, contributing to the site&rsquo;s recognition and creating a lively
atmosphere.


### Option 3: A city for the local residents

Makuhari City, an imaginary city, does not have a physical presence but will be
maintained with its independent budget and personnel. Yet, as we use the word
&ldquo;Makuhari,&rdquo; we will carry out activities that will benefit people living in the
physical Makuhari area (Hanamigawa (花見川区) and Mihama(美浜区) wards of Chiba
City) in some way over the next few years. We will work closely with Chiba City
to directly contribute to the DX promotion of existing government services. This
concept is not new, but it will undoubtedly provide a suitable living
environment for residents and will likely support the local community and
government.

## Q2: Demographics

The Multilayer city &ldquo;Makuhari&rdquo; will be governed in a decentralized manner; the
preferences and characteristics of each resident strongly reflect the fabric of
the town. If you could control the attributes of the citizens in advance, what
kind of population distribution do you think would be desirable? Imagine a city
you would like to live in and choose one. Note that you do not have to follow
the policy in Q1. For example, even if you chose &ldquo;city for artists&rdquo; in Q1, the
low percentage of artists will not contradict. The selected option be
interpreted as the lowest percentage of human resources to accomplish the basic
policy chosen in Q1.

For example, the following assumptions can be made:

More artists and researchers: New perspectives and ideas will emerge without
being bound by existing concepts and rules. There will be a greater openness to
a variety of views. They like diversity and may move toward a more chaotic
environment.

More designers and architects: Problems that many people do not recognize will
be extracted and solved in a way that balances use and beauty. The world view of
a particular designer will be reflected, and the environment will become more
orderly.

More engineers: Not just ideas, but their actual realization will be valued.

More physical residents of the Makuhari area: Policies that prioritize the
community for children and inclusiveness will increase. The trend may avoid
risk-taking, and views making the environment safer and secure will be valued.
